    <p>My mom would make this recipe with the zucchini and tomatoes that would flourish in our garden. It's my favorite casserole.</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 pound pork sausage</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 cup diced fresh tomato</li>
        <li>4 cups cubed zucchini squash</li>
        <li>2 (4 ounce) cans sliced mushrooms, drained</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package processed cheese food, cubed</li>
        <li>1 pinch dried oregano</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>low, and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until tender. Remove from heat, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cook sausage and onion in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring until evenly browned. Drain excess grease. Stir in zucchini and tomatoes, and cook until tender.

    </ol>
